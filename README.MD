# web-notepad

This is just a local storage based notepad for your browser.
I spend a lot of time in my browser and having a place to quickly jot down notes
is convenient, without having to login into 100 places.

Since this is based on local storage, this means it has no fancy note syncing,
but all your notes are "yours" without being sent to some server.
